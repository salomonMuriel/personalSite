# Salomon's Personal Website

This is the code for Salomon Muriel's personal website. It was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), [Talwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), [React Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome/), [Typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) and [FormSpark](https://https://formspark.io/). 

I started out with a great [personal website starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/SaimirKapaj/gatsby-markdown-typescript-personal-website/).

Some learnings: i18n is hard, doing forms for static sites is a headache (but FormSpark is great), and Markdown is really finicky about how you use it.

Use this code as you see fit, just refrain from publishing more websites with my name!

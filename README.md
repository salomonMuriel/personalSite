# Salomon's Personal Website

This is the code for Salomon Muriel's personal website. It was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), [Talwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), [React Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome/) and [FormSpark](https://https://formspark.io/). 

I started out with a great [personal website starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/SaimirKapaj/gatsby-markdown-typescript-personal-website/).

Some learnings: i18n is hard, doing forms for static sites is a headache (but FormSpark is great), and Markdown is really finicky about how you use it.
